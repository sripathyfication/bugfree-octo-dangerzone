Notes:


Computation vs Caching

If there is a result from a previous recursion that is going to be used repeatedly, it makes sense
to cache the results.

For ex: in Fibonacci sequence calculation, some values might be used repeatedly. However, in quick
sort or mergesort the recursion doesn't involved using a previously calculated value.


If such a situation arises, save the calculated result in a cache, and in next recursive calls, if
a result exists already then return that.

Using linear space to solve exponential calls is a very valid way of reducing time complexity.
