 Longest Substring without repetition
 -------------------------------------
 1. Trick is to use a hash datastructure such as a dictionary
 2. Traverse the string for every character mark the position and save the character
    map[char] = i
3. if the char exists in the map, check if its current index is greater than the one already present
4. if so, update the currlen of substring as current index - original position of character
5. if not, do nothing
6. if currlen > max_len , then update max_len with current length as the new max length.
7. Once we reach the end of the string, return maxlen
