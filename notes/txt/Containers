                    General know-how on containers
                    ------------------------------

There are a few different philosophies. libvirt vs cgroups. 

libvirt is a more traditional linux container. 

Docker , rkt etc use cgroups. 


Areas to focus on when working with containers?

1. Cluster management. (Docker swarm, mesos, kubernetes)
2. Container networking (Contiv, flannel etc) 
3. Storage.
4. Security.
5. Policy (ACI, contiv does this too)

Good intro to containers:

Why did libvirt not get more traction?


The combination of highly specialised apps running within containers in conjunction with the
cluster management tools are called microservices. This is a new paradigm in deploying apps
in the server cluster.

Due to this, it became logical to develop a low foot print linux os with just enough to run 
containers. This led to the development of os' like core os, project atomic,
ubuntu snappy, etc.

These are OS with an extremely small foot print.
