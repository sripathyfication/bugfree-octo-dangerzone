What is it:-

    Its a tree (most common implementation is binary tree) with 2 additional properties:
        1. Complete tree, i.e each node is filled, barring the last level.
        2. heap property - each node is either greater or smaller than the child node. 

Min head & Max Heap:-        
    
    A min heap is in one which each node is lesser than the child node. ( Root is smallest node)

    A max heap is in one which each node is greater than the child node. (Root is largest node)


Heap Operations:-

    Heapify-down(i) - pop() operation uses this. Return min or max heap. Replace root with last
    level element and call heapify-down on it.

    Heapify-up(i) - push() operation uses this. Add new node to last level on heap and call
    heapify-up on it.


Applications:-
    
    Prim's algorithm for minimum spanning tree

    Djikstra's algorithm for shortest path.
