What is it:

   Like a queue or stack, but each element has a priority associated with it.
   An element of higher priority will get served before an element of lower priority.
   If there is a tie, order in queue is used to return.

Operations supported:

    push (x) - push an element into the Queue O(log n) sorted by priority
    top(), peek() - O(1) operation, returns the highest priority (or lowest priority) element.
                    Doesn't change the state.
    pop() - Returns and removes the highest priority (or lowest) element in queue.
