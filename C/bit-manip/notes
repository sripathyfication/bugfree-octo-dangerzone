1. To find if a number is odd or even, take number and do bitwise and with 1: if true then number
   odd, else it is even.

   if (n & 1) : odd else even

2. Two numbers are of opposite sign, iff x ^ y is less than zero. 

    if (x ^ y) < 0 : odd else even 

3. To add 1 to an interger:

    -~x 

    -x = ~x + 1
    -~x = x + 1

4. Swapping two numbers without using a third number:
    
   while (x !=y) {

    x = x ^ y;
    y = x ^ y;
    x = x ^ y;
   }
